These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE43176. "Contemporary treatment of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires the assignment of patients to specific risk groups. To explore whether expression profiling of leukemic blasts could accurately distinguish between the known risk groups of AML, we analyzed 130 pediatric and 20 adult AML diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples using the Affymetrix U133A microarray."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
