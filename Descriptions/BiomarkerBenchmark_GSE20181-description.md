These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE20181. "In the present investigation, we have exploited the opportunity provided by neoadjuvant treatment of a group of postmenopausal women with large operable or locally advanced breast cancer (in which therapy is given with the primary tumour remaining within the breast) to take sequential biopsies of the same cancers before and after 10-14 days or 90 days treatment with letrozole."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
