These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE38958. "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial disease of unknown cause. It remains impractical to conduct early diagnosis and predict IPF progression just based on gene expression information. Moreover, the relationship between gene expression and quantitative phenotypic value in IPF keeps controversial. To identify biomarkers to predict survival in IPF, we profiled protein-coding gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
