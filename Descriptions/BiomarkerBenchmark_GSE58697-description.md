These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE58697. "One of the main problems in managing desmoids tumors is their locoregional aggressiveness and their high ability to recur after initial treatment. In our work, with the goal to identify molecular markers that can predict Progression-Free Survival, gene-expression screening was conducted on 128 available independent untreated primary desmoid tumors using cDNA microarray."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
