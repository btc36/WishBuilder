These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE37147. "RNA was isolated from bronchial brushings obtained from current and former smokers with and without COPD. mRNA expression was profiled using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
