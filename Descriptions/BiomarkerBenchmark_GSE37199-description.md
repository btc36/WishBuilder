These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE37199. "Inter-patient prostate cancer (PrCa) heterogeneity results in highly variable patient outcomes. Multi-purpose biomarkers to dissect this heterogeneity are urgently required to improve treatment and accelerate drug development in PrCa. Circulating biomarkers are most practical for evaluating this disease. We pursued the analytical validation and clinical qualification of blood mRNA expression arrays."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
