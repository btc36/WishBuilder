These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE5460. "Predictors built from gene expression data accurately predict ER, PR, and HER2 status, and divide tumor grade into high-grade and low-grade clusters; intermediate-grade tumors are not a unique group. In contrast, gene expression data cannot be used to predict tumor size or lymphatic-vascular invasion."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
