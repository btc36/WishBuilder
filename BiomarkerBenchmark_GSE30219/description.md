These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE30219. "An unexplored consequence of epigenetic alterations associated with cancer is the ectopic expression of tissue-restricted genes. Here, a new strategy was developed to decipher genome-wide expression data in search for these “off-context” gene activations, which consisted first, in identifying a large number of tissue-specific genes normally epigenetically silenced in most somatic cells and second, in using them as cancer biomarkers on an “on/off” basis."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
