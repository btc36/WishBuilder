These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE27342. "Reliable identification of cancer markers can have substantial implications to early detection of cancer. We report here an integrated computational and experimental study on identification of gastric cancer markers in patients tissue and sera based on (i) genome-scale transcriptomic analyses on 80 paired gastric cancer/reference tissues, with the aim of identifying abnormally expressed genes at various subtypes/stages of gastric carcinoma."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
