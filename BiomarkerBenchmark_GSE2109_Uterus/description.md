These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE2109_Uterus. "The mission of expO is to build on the technologies and outcomes of the Human Genome Project to accelerate improved clinical management of cancer patients. IGC's Expression Project for Oncology (expO) seeks to integrate longitudinal clinical annotation with gene expression data for a unique and powerful portrait of human malignancies, providing critical perspective on diagnostic markers, prognostic indicators, and therapeutic targets."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
