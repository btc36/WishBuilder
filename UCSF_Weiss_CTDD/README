This data set contains the transcriptional profiles of 20 normal dorsal skin samples 
from eight-week-old mice. Mice were generated by crossing FVB/N to Mus spretus mice to 
generate F1 mice, and then crossing F1 mice back to the FVB/N strain. 10 of the mice were 
generated from FVB/N mice lacking Hras1 (aka HrasKO, Hras-/-) and 10 were generated from 
FVB/N mice with wild-type Hras1.

EXPRESSION
============================================
expression data are in expression_main.txt

Each row is a summarized probeset value.
Each column is an individual mouse, with the header:
  IDENTIFIER: probeset identifier, assigned by Affymetrix
  (20 unique mouse IDs, corresponding to those listed in the sample attributes files)

Profiling was performed using the Affymetrix MoGene 1.1 (GPL11533). 

Hybridization Protocol:
90uL of hybridization sample were incubated in the Affymetrix GeneTitan Oven instrument 
for 17 hours at 48C. Arrays were processed with the Affymetrix GeneTitan Fluidics Station 
instrument, using the 550039 fluidics script and the GeneTitan Hybridization Module for 
WT Array Plates. An Affymetrix GeneTitan instrument was used to acquire the microarray 
image data.

The matrix file contains log2 transformed, quantile normalized, probe level expression 
values for each skin sample. Normalization was performed with the olgio package of R's 
Bioconductor. Expression data have been restricted to those probes with the type "main", 
indicating that they are actual gene probes and not control probes.

PROBE ATTRIBUTES
============================================
probe data are in probe_attributes.txt. There are 28350 rows in all.
Each row is a separate probe. Each column is a probeset attributes, with the header:
  IDENTIFIER: unique probeset identifier, assigned by Affymetrix
  chrom:      chromosome in MM10 for the gene transcript or probesets
  start:      start location in MM10 for the gene transcript or probesets
  stop:       stop location in MM10 for the gene transcript or probesets
  symbol:     Official symbol for the gene, or the probeset identifier if no gene 
              corresponds to this probeset
  is_refseq:  true or false depending on whether this probeset reports expression for a 
              gene annotated in RefSeq
  refseq_id:  RefSeq identifier of the gene, or NA if not assigned a RefSeq identifier

SAMPLE ATTRIBUTES
============================================
sample data are in sample_attributes.txt

Each row is an individual mouse.
Each column is a sample attribute, with the header:
  IDENTIFIER: unique mouse ID.
  sex:        Mouse sex, where M: male and F: female
  genotype:   Mouse germline Hras1 status, where WT: wild type and KO: Hras1-/-.
  color:      Color of the mouse, where A: agouti (tan) and W: white (albino)
