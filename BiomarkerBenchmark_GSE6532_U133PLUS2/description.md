These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE6532_U133PLUS2. "A number of microarray studies have reported distinct molecular profiles of breast cancers (BC): basal-like, ErbB2-like and two to three luminal-like subtypes. These were associated with different clinical outcomes. However, although the basal and the ErbB2 subtypes are repeatedly recognized, identification of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtypes has been inconsistent. Refinement of their molecular definition is therefore needed."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
