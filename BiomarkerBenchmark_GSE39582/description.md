These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE39582. "From a clinical and molecular perspective, colon cancer (CC) is a heterogeneous disease but to date no classification based on high-density transcriptome data has been established. The aim of this study was to build up a robust molecular classification ofmRNA expression profiles (Affymetrix U133Plus2) ofa large series of 443 CC and 19 non-tumoral colorectal mucosas, and to validate it on an independent serie of 123 CC and 906 public dataset."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
