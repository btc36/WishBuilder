These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE10320. "The gene expression patterns of favorable histology Wilms tumors (FHWT) that relapsed were compared with those that did not relapse using oligonucleotide arrays."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensemble identifiers.
