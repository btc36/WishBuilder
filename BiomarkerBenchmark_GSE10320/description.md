These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set 10320.

"The gene expression patterns of favorable histology Wilms tumors (FHWT) that relapsed were compared with those that did not relapse using oligonucleotide arrays."

Comment(s): The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
