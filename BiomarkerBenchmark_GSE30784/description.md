These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE30784. "OSCC is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. To identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of invasive OSCC, we compared the gene expressions of OSCC, oral dysplasia, and normal oral tissue from patients without oral cancer or preneoplastic oral lesions (controls)."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
