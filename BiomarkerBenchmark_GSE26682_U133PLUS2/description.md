These data were derived from Gene Expression Omnibus data set GSE26682_U133PLUS2. "We have performed bioinformatic approaches to identify the level of enrichment between gene expression profiles characterizing MSI tumors and gene changes induced in vitro by the PARP-1 inhibitor Phenanthridinone and others using the Connectivity Map tool."

Comment(s): This data set was curated as part of the [Biomarker Benchmark project](https://osf.io/ssk3t/). The expression data were normalized using the [SCAN algorithm](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SCAN.UPC.html) and summarized at the gene level using Ensembl identifiers.
